Error (204012): Can't generate netlist output files because the file "T:/FPGA_Projects/Qsys_Projects/ClosedLoop_System/NiosII_Controlled_Section/synthesis/submodules/NiosII_Controlled_Section_NiosII_cpu.v" is an OpenCore Plus time-limited file. Remove the unlicensed cores or obtain a license for those OpenCore Plus time-limited IP cores used in the design. The Intel FPGA Knowledge Database contains many articles with specific details on how to resolve this error. Visit the Knowledge Database at https://www.altera.com/support/support-resources/knowledge-base/search.html and search for this specific error message number.
